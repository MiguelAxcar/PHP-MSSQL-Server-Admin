# PHP-MSSQL-Server-Admin
PHP MSSQL Server Admin try to provide a web interface where you can run queries on a Microsoft SQL Server using PHP. Like PHPMyAdmin, but much simpler. Initially written by me, Luiz Miguel Axcar, when I needed to interact with a MSSQL server, back in 2007, so expect a very old coding pattern. Code highlight, table/field browser, top records, most used tables, etc.
